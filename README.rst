SystemVerilog Toys Repository
=============================

"svtoys" is a library of diversions to demonstrate how to abuse the
SystemVerilog language to play games. According to the IEEE 1800-2009
specification, SystemVerilog is a "unified hardware design, specification,
and verification standard language". According to me, it is a
design-by-committee, Frankenstein monster of a language. Nevertheless, it has
many features that are super awesome. In particular, we enjoy using the random
constraint solver to do things such as solve Sudoku puzzles.

All targets are compiled and tested using Synopsys VCS. SystemVerilog is a
notoriously vendor-dependent language implementation, so we do not guarantee
that this code will work on your simulator of choice.
